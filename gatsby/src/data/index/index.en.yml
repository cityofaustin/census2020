  title: What is the Census?
  content:
    - Every 10 years, every person living in the United States - regardless of origin or status - is required to fill out the Census. This is a requirement of the United States Constitution in order to provide an accurate count of all people in the country. Federal funding for our local schools, transportation dollars for roads and buses, and healthcare services for aging and needy are all  funded based on the Census. The political lines that are drawn for Congress, State House seats, and even school board members, are based on Census data.
    - If Austin and Travis County residents are undercounted in 2020, every Central Texan is negatively impacted. The next Census is in Spring 2020. This is our chance to come together and make sure every resident is counted, so every federal dollar we deserve is accounted for.

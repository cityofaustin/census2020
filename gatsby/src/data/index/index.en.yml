  title: What is the Census
  content:
    - Every 10 years, people across the country and in Texas fill out the Census in order to have an accurate count of all people in the United States. The Census determines Texas’s federal funding for important community services that help support our families and fair share of representation in Texas and Washington D.C.
    - The next Census is in Spring 2020. Let’s ensure all Texans are counted so we can put those resources to good use here at home!

  content:
    - Cada 10 años, los habitantes de Texas completan el Censo para tener un conteo preciso de cada persona. Con el Censo se deciden cuáles serán nuestros fondos federales para importantes servicios comunitarios que apoyan a nuestras familias y nuestra participación en el poder político, en Texas y en Washington, D.C.
    - El siguiente Censo se realizará en la primavera de 2020. Asegurémonos de que se cuenten todos los habitantes de Texas para conservar esos recursos.

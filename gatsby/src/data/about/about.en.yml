    title: About the 2020 Census
    text:
      - The City of Austin and Travis County have launched a Census Outreach Campaign to ensure residents are educated and prepared for the 2020 Census. Every ten years the U.S. Census Bureau oversees a confidential survey of the whole country to determine population totals and breakdowns by sex, age, race and other demographic factors. Next year, between March and July, individuals will be able to respond online, by phone, or by mail.
      - "The Census information guides the allocation of more than $800 billion in federal funding to programs across the U.S. that are crucial to the well-being of families and communities. If Texas residents are undercounted by even 1% Texas could lose at least $300 million per year in critical programs affecting everyone, especially vulnerable children and other at-risk populations. Some of the programs affected in Austin and Travis County include:"
      - "<ul>
        <li>Medicare and Medicaid</li>
        <li>Head Start program</li>
        <li>National School Lunch Program</li>
        <li>Special Education grants</li>
        <li>Highway planning and construction</li>
        <li>State Childrenâ€™s Health Insurance (CHIP)</li>
        "
      - Counting everyone can be logistically challenging. Very young children, immigrants, people who live in rural areas, people of color, people who move residences more frequently, and people who face language barriers, are often harder to count.
      - The 2020 Census is an opportunity to get as many people as possible to participate in order to shape our future. Your Census responses are safe and secure. Information collected as part of the 2020 Census cannot be shared with or by other governmental agencies or used against you in any way, as dictated under Title 13 of the U.S. code. It is for statistical purposes only. All Census Bureau staff take a lifetime oath to protect your personal information, and any violation comes with a penalty of up to $250,000 and/or up to 5 years in prison.

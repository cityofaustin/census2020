      Every ten years the U.S. Census Bureau oversees a confidential survey of
      the whole country to determine population totals and breakdowns by sex,
      age, race and other demographic factors. This year between March and July,
      individuals will be able to respond online, by phone, or by mail.


      Your response to the 2020 Census will help guide more than $800 billion in
      federal funding to programs across the U.S. that are crucial to our
      families and our community.


      If Texas residents are undercounted by even 1% Texas could lose at least
      $300 million per year in programs that affect all of us, especially
      vulnerable children and other at-risk populations. Census data determines
      funding allocations for programs that: 


      * Improve health services and programs

      * Improve local schools and education opportunities

      * Enhance streets and roads

      * Increase jobs and business opportunities

      Austin and Travis County are coming together to ensure that everyone in
      our communities are counted in the 2020 Census!


      We have the power to shape the future of our state and our country by
      participating in the 2020 Census. This is our chance to uplift our
      communities and we must work together to ensure everyone is counted. Texas
      is stronger with a complete count.

title: Get Involved and Get out the Count!
intro: >-
  Our goal is to achieve a full and complete count of all Texans. Please help
  spread the word and ensure you, your family, neighbors, and friends are all
  counted!


  The Austin-Travis County 2020 Census Complete Count Committee is a
  nonpartisan, grassroots civic organization that encourages volunteer
  participation from everyone in our community and open to all racial
  backgrounds and all gender identities. Our goal is to increase our communityâ€™s
  understanding and awareness around the importance of the U.S. Census here at
  home.


  Join in on the Census 10-Day Challenge as we count down the final days of
  responding to the Census. Information can be found

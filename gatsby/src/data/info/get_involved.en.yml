      Austin and Travis County are coming together to ensure that everyone in
      our communities are counted in the 2020 Census! The Census uplifts the
      voices of our families, friends and neighbors across the State. The power
      to shape our future is in our hands. Shoutouts to partners here?


      This spring, we have the power to shape the future of our state and our
      country by participating in the 2020 Census. This is our chance to uplift
      our communities and we must work together to ensure everyone is counted.
      Texas is stronger with a complete count. For more information, contact
      <mailto:census@traviscountytx.gov>.

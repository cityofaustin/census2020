  - There is a lot at stake in the 2020 Census and our communities can't afford an undercount. Essential neighborhood resources like street improvements, school lunches for children in need, and housing for seniors and families will all be gained or lost in the 2020 Census.
  - "We only get one chance every 10 years to count all of our residents, and with so many new folks moving in and others being forced to move to new parts of town, no Census has ever been more important for Austin and the County of Travis. This Census count will also help local elected officials  inform important decisions and determine federal funding allocations for a decade. In 2010, significant undercounts occurred across local communities in Texas, including in portions of: Large metropolitan areas, College towns, Rural counties, and Communities along the Texas/Mexico border."
  - The mail-in self-response rate for Travis County in the 2010 Census was 75.9%, which required a costly and difficult in-person follow-up for the remaining 24.1% of residents. Historically, children under 5 have been undercounted, 2.1% of children under the age of five in Travis County were undercounted in the 2010 Census.
  - Our most recent research estimates that reaching Travis County residents in hard-to-count neighborhoods at a basic level of $2 dollars per person (mailers, a couple public forms, and some level of direct outreach) would cost at least $742,000 dollars. Most recent data as of 2017 shows that 11.6% of the countyâ€™s households had either no internet access or dial-up only.

  body: Texas is at risk of an even larger undercount in 2020. Today, 25% of Texans (over 6 million people) live in hard-to-count neighborhoods, where past self-response rates have been relatively low. Today in Travis County, 32% (over 370,000 people) of the population live in hard-to-count neighborhoods. An undercount means Texas is not getting its fair share of funding and representation since not everyone living in our state was counted. View the map below to see if your neighborhood is at risk of being undercounted.

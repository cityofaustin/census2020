title: Why the Census Matters
intro: >-
  A lot is at stake in the 2020 Census, and our communities can't afford an
  undercount. Essential neighborhood resources like street improvements, school
  lunches for children in need, and housing for seniors and families will all be
  gained or lost because of the 2020 Census.

      We only get one chance every 10 years to count all of our residents. With
      so many new folks moving in and others being forced to move to new parts
      of town, no Census has ever been more important for Austin and Travis
      County. This Census count will also help local elected officials inform
      important decisions and determine federal funding allocations for the next
      decade.

      * In 2010, undercounts occurred across Texas in large metropolitan areas,
      college towns, rural counties, and communities along the border

      * The mail-in self-response rate for Travis County in the 2010 Census was
      75.9%, which required a costly and difficult in-person follow-up for the
      remaining 24.1% of residents.

      * 2.1% of children under the age of five in Travis County were
      undercounted in the 2010 Census.

      * Our most recent research estimates that reaching Travis County residents
      in hard-to-count neighborhoods at a basic level of $2 dollars per person
      (mailers, a couple public forms, and some level of direct outreach) would
      cost at least $742,000 dollars.

      * Most recent data shows that 11.6% of Travis Countyâ€™s households had
      either no internet access or dial-up only.

      Many communities in Texas, including ours, have been underrepresented or
      undercounted in the past Census efforts. An undercount means Texas is not
      getting its fair share of funding and representation since not everyone
      living in our state was counted. Counting everyone can be logistically
      challenging. Those who are at risk of being undercounted in the 2020
      Census are:


      * Very young children

      * Immigrants

      * People who live in rural areas

      * People of color

      * People who move residences more frequently

      * People who face language barriers


      The 2020 Census is an opportunity to get as many people as possible to
      participate in order to shape our future.

      Texas is at risk of an even larger undercount in 2020. Today, 25% of
      Texans, or over 6 million people, live in hard-to-count neighborhoods,
      where past self-response rates have been relatively low. Today in Travis
      County, 32% (over 370,000 people) of the population live in hard-to-count
      neighborhoods. An undercount means Texas is not getting its fair share of
      funding and representation since not everyone living in our state was
      counted. View the map below to see if your neighborhood is at risk of
      being undercounted.

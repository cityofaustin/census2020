  title: What is the Census?
  content:
    - Every 10 years, every person living in the United States - regardless of origin or status - is required to fill out the Census. This is a requirement of the United States Constitution in order to provide an accurate count of all people in the country. Federal funding for our local schools, transportation dollars for roads and buses, and healthcare services are all funded based on the Census. The political lines that are drawn for Congress, State House seats, and even school board members, are based on Census data.
    - If Austin and Travis County residents are undercounted in 2020, every Central Texan is negatively impacted.
    - The next Census is in Spring 2020. This is our chance to come together and make sure every resident is counted, so every federal dollar we deserve is accounted for.

    faqs:
      - question: Why is it important for everyone to be counted in the Census?
        response: >-
          * Some federal funds, grants, and support to states, counties and
          communities are based on population.

          * It is critical for everyone to be counted, regardless of immigration
          status. When you respond to the Census, you help your community get
          its fair share of federal funds.

          * Businesses use Census data to decide where to build factories,
          offices and stores, and this creates jobs.

          * Developers use Census data to build new homes and revitalize
          neighborhoods.

          * Local governments use Census data for public safety and emergency
          preparedness.
      - question: How do you get counted?
        response: >-
          *  Starting mid-March 2020, each household will receive a postcard in
          the mail informing them of the options for filling out the Census
          questionnaire. That includes online, by phone, or with a paper form.

          * Households that do not fill out the questionnaire during the
          self-response period will be contacted by the U.S. Census Bureau
          during Non-Response Follow-Up. 


          March 12-20: Households will receive an invitation to respond online
          to the 2020 Census. Some households will also receive paper
          questionnaires.


          March 16-24: A reminder letter will be sent.


          **If you still have not responded:**


          March 26-April 3: A reminder postcard will be sent to households that
          have not responded.


          April 8-16: A reminder letter and paper questionnaire will be sent.


          April 20-27: A final reminder postcard before the U.S. Census Bureau
          follows up in person.


          U.S. Census Bureau enumerators may contact households that submit
          partially filled-out questionnaires in an effort to obtain complete
          answers.
      - question: What should a Texan be aware of when filling out the Census?
        response: >-
          It is critical to be cautious of any requests that seem suspicious.


          The U.S. Census Bureau will never ask for the following


          * Payment to fill out the questionnaire

          * Social Security number

          * Financial information


          U.S. Census Bureau field staff will always show a valid Census Bureau
          ID. You can confirm that they are a U.S. Census Bureau employee by
          entering their name into the Census Bureau Staff Search or by
          contacting the Texas Regional Office at 1-800-852-6159


          It is a federal crime to impersonate a federal official, and anyone
          who violates this law is subject to imprisonment.
      - question: Is private information protected?
        response: >-
          * The United States Census Bureau (USCB) is required by law to protect
          any personal information it collects and keep it confidential.

          * The U.S. Census Bureau is bound by Title 13 of the United States
          Code. These laws not only provide the Bureau with authority for its
          work, but also stipulate strong protections for the information the
          Census collects from individuals and businesses.

          * The U.S. Census Bureau uses responses to produce statistics.

          * Private information may not be published when it is collected. After
          72 years, it may be published for historical purposes by the National
          Archives. It is against the law to disclose or publish any private
          information that identifies an individual or business, such as names,
          addresses (including GPS coordinates), Social Security numbers, and
          telephone numbers.

          * Answers cannot be used for law enforcement purposes or to determine
          personal eligibility for government benefits.

          * Personal information cannot be used against respondents for the
          purposes of immigration enforcement.

          * U.S. Census Bureau employees are sworn to protect confidentiality.
          Every person with access to data is sworn for life to protect personal
          information and understands that the penalties for violating this law
          are applicable for a lifetime.

          * Violating confidentiality or sharing the information other than for
          statistical purposes is a serious federal crime. Anyone who violates
          this law will face severe penalties, including a federal prison
          sentence of up to five years, a fine of up to $250,000, or both.
      - question: Will the 2020 Census include a question about Citizenship?
        response: " The 2020 Census questionnaire will NOT include a question about an individual’s citizenship status. Everyone, regardless of their immigration status, has certain basic rights. For those who have concerns about opening your doors, there are other ways you can participate. You can participate from the comfort of your home online and over the phone, or at community run assistance center. Please complete your Census questionnaire. An incomplete questionnaire may increase your chances of nonresponse follow-up by the U.S. Census Bureau. Households will receive an invitation to respond online to the 2020 Census beginning March 12, 2020. Your participation is vital, and your information is protected. "
      - question: >-
          What is the Austin-Travis County Complete Count Committee doing to
          encourage participation?
        response: >-
          * The Austin-Travis County Complete Count Committee is supporting a
          coordinated outreach and communication effort focused on reaching the
          hard-to-count (HTC) population. This Committee is collaborating and
          leveraging support from local governments, regional and statewide
          community-based organizations, nonprofit, education, and other
          agencies to ensure the hardest to count communities are reached.
          Communication efforts will aim to help our residents understand that
          their information will remain private and dispel misinformation.

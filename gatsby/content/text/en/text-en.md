      - question: What should a Texan be aware of when filling out the Census?
        response: "
          <p>It is critical to be cautious of any requests that seem suspicious.</p>
          <p>The U.S. Census Bureau will never ask for the following:</p>
          <ul>
          <li>Payment to fill out the questionnaire</li>
          <li>Social Security number</li>
          <li> Financial information</li>
          </ul>
          <p>U.S. Census Bureau field staff will always show a valid Census Bureau ID. You can confirm that they are a U.S. Census Bureau employee by entering their name into the Census Bureau Staff Search or by contacting the Texas Regional Office at 1-800-852-6159.</p>
          <p>It is a federal crime to impersonate a federal official, and anyone who violates this law is subject to imprisonment.</p>
          "
      - question: "Is private information protected?"
        response: "
          <ul>
          <li>The United States Census Bureau (USCB) is required by law to protect any personal information it collects and keep it confidential.</li>
          <li>The U.S. Census Bureau is bound by Title 13 of the United States Code. These laws not only provide the Bureau with authority for its work, but also stipulate strong protections for the information the Census collects from individuals and businesses.</li>
          <li>The U.S. Census Bureau uses responses to produce statistics.</li> <li>Private information may not be published when it is collected. After 72 years, it may be published for historical purposes by the National Archives. It is against the law to disclose or publish any private information that identifies an individual or business, such as names, addresses (including GPS coordinates), Social Security numbers, and telephone numbers.</li>
          <li>Answers cannot be used for law enforcement purposes or to determine personal eligibility for government benefits.</li>
          <li>Personal information cannot be used against respondents for the purposes of immigration enforcement.</li>
          <li>U.S. Census Bureau employees are sworn to protect confidentiality. Every person with access to data is sworn for life to protect personal information and understands that the penalties for violating this law are applicable for a lifetime.</li>
          <li>Violating confidentiality or sharing the information other than for statistical purposes is a serious federal crime. Anyone who violates this law will face severe penalties, including a <span>federal prison sentence of up to five years, a fine of up to $250,000, or both.</span>
          </ul>"
      - question: "Will the 2020 Census include a question about Citizenship?"
        response: "
          The 2020 Census questionnaire will NOT include a question about an individual’s citizenship status. Everyone, regardless of their immigration status, has certain basic rights. For those who have concerns about opening your doors, there are other ways you can participate. You can participate from the comfort of your home online and over the phone, or at community run assistance center. Please complete your Census questionnaire. An incomplete questionnaire may increase your chances of nonresponse follow-up by the U.S. Census Bureau. Households will receive an invitation to respond online to the 2020 Census beginning March 12, 2020. Your participation is vital, and your information is protected.
          "
      - question: "What is the Austin-Travis County Complete Count Committee doing to encourage participation?"
        response: "
          <ul>
          <li>The Austin-Travis County Complete Count Committee is supporting a coordinated outreach and communication effort focused on reaching the hard-to-count (HTC) population.
